Information Technology 101
Good morning students! 
Today I want to talk about application development. As you know, to begin you need a good computer with solid components. Having the right hardware will help you to develop quality software that works without crashing.
I always follow certain rules when I build a new app:
1. The data for the application should be stored in a relational database
2. Customers should be able to buy my application on the Internet
3. The software should work without any extra peripherals
4. The program should be designed to work with or without a solid network connection.
By following these simple rules, you can write great applications that work for everyone.
The end.
